web development project 1
I built this website as an assignment for my web development class. It was built with the help of a GeeksForGeeks tutorial on how to make a cake shop website. I've added many more elements onwards.
Being an online cheesecake shop website, it possesses several elements including a landing page, with a menu section, an about section, a custom order section and a contact section. Other than the landing page, we have a profile page called My Account containing account information, My Orders containing past and current orders information, My Addresses with user's saved addresses and My Wallet with the user's payment options.
The above pages can be accessed by a profile icon on the top left corner of the landing page.
The landing page also possesses a cart on the top left corner which directs a user to the my cart page, where 2 items have already been added (I'm working on customising adding orders in the cart).
There is a checkout option on the my cart page, which when clicked takes you to a thank you for your order page (which also needs to be customised for specific orders and addresses)
On the landing page, there are quicklinks in the header as well as the footer for the home, about, menu and contact sections, and a form type newsletter subscription in the footer. There is also a review option, which further needs to be customised for every user to give ratings.
In the contact section, there are links for instagram and email to contact the shop.
A ratings section needs to be added.
